# ARCatalog

An agumented reality application that can download 3D Collada and PNG files to build on-the-fly AR Scenes. 

Designed to be a potential sales tool, this app allows fast placement of objects, take photos of your object in its surroundings, and allows quick management and sharing of your photos. Photos are stored within the app directory, keeping your photo albums clean. 

Key Points:
- Google Firebase Integrations (Core, Firestore, Auth)
- On-The-Fly download and compiling of AR Scenes
- 3rd Party Libraries (Alamofire, SimpleImageViewer)
- Peer to Peer sharring (in WIP)
